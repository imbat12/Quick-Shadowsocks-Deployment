1) Get yourself an ubuntu 20.04 server from a VPS provider ( Linode, DigitalOcean etc) which costs about 5$ a month.
- https://www.linode.com/ 
- https://www.digitalocean.com/
- There are more VPS providers out there, feel free to check them out.
2) SSH into your server (If you are on windows use PuTTy or powershell, If on macOS or Linux just use ssh directly from the terminal like so -> " ssh root@YOUR SERVER's IP ")
- PuTTY can be found at : https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/
3) Update server and install snap with -> " ***sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imbat12/Quick-Shadowsocks-Deployment/main/ubuntu-20.04-setup.sh | bash*** " - On 22.04 press ENTER on any prompt that shows up until it asks you to manualy reboot. Then press CTRL+C and type in "reboot".
4) Your server just rebooted, keep calm and SSH into it again then proceed to step 5.
5) Install shadowsocks with -> " ***sudo curl :https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imbat12/Quick-Shadowsocks-Deployment/main/ubuntu-20.04-ss.sh | bash*** "
6) Change the default password by editing this file -> " ***nano /var/snap/shadowsocks-libev/common/etc/shadowsocks-libev/config.json*** "
7) After putting in your new password press ***CONTROL + O*** then press ***ENTER*** to save then press ***CONTROL+X*** to exit.
8) Reboot the server again after changing your password -> " ***reboot*** "
9) You are done, get yourself a client from the releases section.
